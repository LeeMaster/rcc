# rcc

Yet another Rust implementation of `Retargetable C Compiler`

Claim down, implement a simple c language compiler is really interesting.
This project is inspired by [Retargetable C Compiler, A: Design and Implementation](https://www.amazon.com/Retargetable-Compiler-Design-Implementation/dp/0805316701)
Moreover, in the future I will construct a LC3 VM to execute the compiled object, I will named it as `rc3` and create a new generator for this compiler to generate the `LC3` ISA.
You could find more  details about this project will be published on my personal blog.

Enjoy yourself :)
