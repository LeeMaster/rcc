Claim down, implement a simple c language compiler is really interesting.

Inspired by [Retargetable C Compiler, A: Design and Implementation](https://www.amazon.com/Retargetable-Compiler-Design-Implementation/dp/0805316701)

In the future I will construct a LC3 VM to execute the compiled object. 

More details about this project will be published on my personal blog.
